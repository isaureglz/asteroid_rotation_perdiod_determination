# asteroid_rotation_perdiod_determination

This Python script was produced in the context of the C2PU (Centre Pédagogique Planète Univers) module of the MAUCA (Master track in Astrophysics in Université Côte d'Azur). The goal was to retrieve the rotation period of asteroid Bulgaria, using C2PU data.
We plot the flux as a function of time and fit a sine model to the data. Assuming period_model = (rotation_period)/2, we can retrieve Bulgaria's rotation period.
